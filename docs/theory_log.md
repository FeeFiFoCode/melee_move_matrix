## 🗓️ [2025-05-30] — Initial Layer Model and Dialectical Lens

### Framing

We hypothesize a **three-layer structure** of move utility:

1. **Tool-Based Description (Data Grounded)**  
   - What does the move *do* mechanically?
   - Features: startup, active windows, IASA, hitbox placement, angle, damage
   - Example: “Falcon bair is a fast-rising, backward-facing aerial with high knockback”

2. **Articulated Use (Player Emergent)**  
   - How do players *use* the tool in context?
   - Movement, drift, intent, rhythm, reaction vs prediction
   - Example: “Falcon bair is used as a fade-back wall or as a burst punish”

3. **Discursive/Counterplay Layer (Dialectical Tension)**  
   - How does intent, metagame, or opponent reaction create layered meaning?
   - Bluff vs commitment, preemptive vs reactive, pressure vs bait
   - Example: “Falcon bair conditions opponent to shield, sets up grab; player may switch to empty short-hop”

### Implications

- The term *"poke"* may sit at the intersection of all three:
  - A move *with low commitment and mid-range coverage* (data)
  - *Used* to test or force reactions (player)
  - *Interpreted* as threat, bait, or callout (opponent/counterplay)

- Taxonomy must be **relational**, not fixed — built from observed groupings but open to reclassification.

## 🧭 Thoughts for Future Entries

- Define “archetype” vs “expression” vs “subversion”
- Track outlier functions (e.g. Game & Watch dair, Peach fair)
- Use clustering results to propose candidate functional cores
- Consider rhythm, tempo, and psychological threat profiles

## 🔜 Questions To Explore

- Can we define poke/wall/anti-air/etc. using bounding conditions?
- How do options mutate when drift or fastfall is added?
- Should we model mixups and move usage flow as grammars or decision trees?
