# Melee Move Matrix

**Melee Move Matrix** is a public research and analysis project aiming to categorize and cluster moves in *Super Smash Bros. Melee* based on their frame data, hitbox properties, and functional in-game roles. 

We believe that move design can be understood not just by raw numbers, but through how those numbers interact with movement, positioning, and intention. This project offers a data-driven taxonomy of move types — from pokes and anti-airs to walls and mixup tools.

---

## Goals

- Build a functional taxonomy of Melee moves grounded in frame data and hitbox placement.
- Cluster similar moves across the roster using statistical analysis and visualization.
- Provide insights for players, designers, and analysts interested in move function and design intent.

---

## Features (Planned)

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of frame data across all characters
- 📊 Clustering moves based on startup, active frames, endlag, multi-hit structure, and more
- 🎮 Functional role mapping (e.g., poke, wall, trap, bait, callout)
- 🧠 Tagging and visualization of move articulations
- 🛠️ Tooling for custom filtering and export

## Credits

- Built using community frame data JSONs.
- Inspired by frameworks from Kira, Kadano, Uncle Punch, and the broader FGC lab scene.
